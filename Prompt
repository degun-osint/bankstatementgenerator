Hello,
I want a Python script who will generate a csv please.

These variables :
- startDate = start date for the data
- endDate = end date for the data
- rowsNumber = number of lines on the file
- fileName = csv filename
- fixCharge = a dictionnary with key :label, values : amount

Then, generate a csv file with these columns filed with random data:
- Date (within the date range between startDate and endDate)
- Type : "Debit"
- Amount : random amount between -1000 and -10
- Label : a random label from a list of 50 imaginaries companies you will invent

Then, add a line for every month in the date range, one row for every element in the fixCharge Dictionnary with these columns :
- Date : every month in the date range
- Type : if the values is positive : "Credit", if the value is negative : "Debit"
- amount : value in fixCharge
- Label : key in fixCharge

Finally, sort data by Date, add an ID to every rows and write the CSV.

Thanks a lot !
